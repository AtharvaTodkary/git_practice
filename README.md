# git_practice
I'll practice git here
git clone 'link'  #clones the repository locally
git status        #gives the status  of files in the repository(untracked, staged, commited, Update)
git add demoat.txt  #adds demoat.txt into repo(not pushing), once added status becomes 'A'
git commit -m "Atharva has commited"   #commits demoat.txt into repo printing msg "Atharva has commited"
git push origin main   #pushing it into main branch
